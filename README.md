# 4x4-hex

This is a Python 3 controller for my 4x4 Hex challenge on PPCG.
Usage (assuming your Python 3 command is `python3`):

    python3 hex-controller.py

You can change the parameters within the script file.
If your strategy is not winning, the controller will output a losing game in reverse order.
Use the file `test.py` to test the controller.
